# DAF : DYNAMIC-ADAPTIVE-FINE-TUNING-OF-VISION-TRANSFORMERS
a novel dynamic reconfiguration paradigm for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) that adaptively adjusts the trainable structure during training to achieve a great performance
> Our paper is currently under submission to ICLR 2026. The code will be released upon acceptance (expected around early 2026).
